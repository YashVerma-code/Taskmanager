# 📝 TaskFlow - Advanced Task Management System

## 🚀 Introduction

**TaskFlow** is a responsive and intuitive **task management application** designed to streamline workflow and enhance productivity. It features a modern **Kanban-style interface** with sections for **To-Do**, **On-Progress**, and **Done** tasks. 

Users can **add, update, reschedule, delete, and drag-and-drop tasks** seamlessly between sections — except for tasks marked as **completed**, which are locked from further movement. With its clean design and responsive layout, TaskFlow offers a user-friendly experience across devices.
